My site has been built using the R package [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and I built my own theme:.[wyrfraym](https://github.com/NicJC/MathStats)

<p>

To get started with your own Hugo blog, I have provided some helpful links below.
Both Alison and Amber's blogs below are inspiring and provide some guidance.
There is also a link to the blogdown book, which would be my first port of call, and then there's the Hugo Community.
