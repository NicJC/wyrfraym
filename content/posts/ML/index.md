Machine learning has simple beginnings in probability and simple linear regression.


```
Let's consider linear regression basics!

Work through the 2 below examples to understand how the numbers fit in linear regression.

1. [Simple linear regression](https://nicstats.netlify.app/posts/python-simple-linear-regression/)

2. [Least Squares](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NicJC/wyrfraym/blob/27252ec121af5c91fa578e45f3ec3ed721744e05/content/posts/ML%20LSE/Least%20Squares%20linear%20regression.ipynb)
